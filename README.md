# ARCTIC ERMINE
> Pipeline for extracting lightcurves from time-series photometry data taken with the ARCTIC instrument on the ARC 3.5-m Telescope at Apache Point Observatory.

The ARCTIC Extracting Relative Magnitudes to INvestigate Exoplanets (ERMINE) pipeline is designed to reduce time-series photometry data from the Astrophysical Research Consortium (ARC) Telescope Imagine Camera (ARCTIC) on the ARC 3.5-m Telescope. Data is assumed to have been taking with (1) the use of a diffuser and (2) in multiple band-passes.
